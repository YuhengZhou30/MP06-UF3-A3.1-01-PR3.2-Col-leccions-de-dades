When my node is synced the transactions settle in ~30 sec so it won't be an issue but just for my understanding; I think I get why the cardano-wallet has the utxo distribution endpoint now. I'm currently using a high level API that simplifies transaction building but if I wanted more control I could use a lower level client and use one of the algorithms you mentioned or implement my own utxo selection method? It doesn't really matter when transactions are expected to settle in a short period but for certain smart contract durations it might end up being important."
